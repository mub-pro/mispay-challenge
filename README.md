I developed an application to represent data from NASA, showcasing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The application provides two display modes: a chart and a table.

Due to the daily API rate limit in the NASA system, I collected a sample of the main API data and stored it in a JSON file for use.

Here are some screenshots of the App:
